# Apt World

**Apt World** is a lightweight command-line tool written in Python that parses the `/var/lib/dpkg/status` file on Debian-based systems to display a clean list of packages explicitly installed by the user.

This repository includes a **Debian package** that installs the script to `/usr/local/bin/apt-world`, making it easy to run from anywhere on your system.
